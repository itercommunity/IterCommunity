WP Curtain is a simple plugin that allows you to hide your website from the general public and display an elegant countdown timer.

== Description ==
WP Curtain allows you to hide your website from the general public and search engines. Logged in users with a specified access level (e.g. Editor) can still view the website but all other visitors are redirected to a friendly error page. The plugin also includes a beautiful countdown timer (FlipClock) and a log in section.

**Features:**

1. Highly customizable. You can easily change the error messages from the control panel.
2. Has an optional countdown timer so you can tell your visitors exactly when your site will come back online.
3. You get to decide which visitors see the website. For instance you can change the settings so that only editors and administrators can access the front-end.
4. An optional log in box is also included so your visitors can log in without having to visit the default WP login page.
5. Use the included control panel to change plugin settings. It is listed under Plugins > WP Curtain Settings

**IMPORTANT**

1. The login box will not be visible to people who are already logged in
2. The countdown timer will not show up unless you provide valid date and time in settings
