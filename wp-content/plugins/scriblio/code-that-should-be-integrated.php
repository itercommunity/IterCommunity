The above case required different sort keys for different types of queries, a problem made more complex because the design rule was that each household in the records only be listed once if the query parameters matched multiple members of a single household. That alone wasn't hard, but properly sorting the individual members when the query didn't match multiple members of a household and mixing results that were grouped and ungrouped in the same list blah blah blahâ€¦

The sort keys were updated every time the post was saved.
