The powerful and easy-to-use tool to improve security and define access to your 
posts, pages and backend areas for single blog or multisite network.

== Description ==

**Advanced Access Manager** (aka **AAM**) is known nowadays as one of the best  
access control and security enhancement tool. It is easy-to-use and at the same  
time very powerful plugin that gives you the flexible control over your single  
blog or multisite network.

With **AAM** you can control access to different areas of your website like posts, 
pages, categories, widgets or menus. The access can be defined for any user, role 
or visitor.

Below is the list of highlighted features that has been implemented and proved in
current **AAM** version:

**Secure Admin Login**.
Control the login process to your website. Define the number or possible login
attempts, trace the failed login request's geographical location, lockout IP 
addresses for potential hacker attacks.

**Control Access to Posts, Pages or Categories**.
Restrict access to your posts, pages, custom post types of categories for any
user, role or visitor. Define whether the viewer can ''see'', ''read'' or ''comment'' 
on any post or page. For more extended list of possible options consider to get 
the [AAM Plus Package](http://wpaam.com/aam-extensions/aam-plus-package/). To 
learn more about this feature check our 
[Posts and Pages Tutorial](http://wpaam.com/tutorials/posts-pages-general-overview/).

**Control Access to Media Files**.
Define your custom access to media files for any user, role or visitor. The feature 
works without any extra configurations to your server .htaccess file. Find more 
information about this topic in our 
[Tutorial](http://wpaam.com/tutorials/control-access-to-media-files/).

**Manage Roles and Capabilities**.
Manage the list of roles and capabilities. This feature has been designed and tested 
by hundreds of experienced WordPress user and developers. It gives you possibility 
to create, update or delete any role or capability. For security reasons, this 
feature is limited by default but can be easily activated. Read more about it in 
our [AAM Super Admin Tutorial](http://wpaam.com/tutorials/aam-super-admin/).

**Track User Activity**.
Track logged in user activities like when user was logged in or logged out. Explore 
more tracking options with [AAM Activities](http://wpaam.com/aam-extensions/aam-activities/).

**Filter Backend Menu**.
Control access to backend menu (including submenus). For more information check  
[How to Manage Admin Menu](http://wpaam.com/tutorials/how-to-manage-admin-menu/).

**Filter Metaboxes and Widgets**.
Filter available metaboxes or widgets for any user, role or visitor.

And many, many more...

The **AAM** has multi-language UI:

 * English
 * German (by Kolja www.Reggae-Party.de)
 * Spanish (by Etruel www.netmdp.com)
 * Polish (by Gustaw Lasek www.servitium.pl)
 * French (by Moskito7)
 * Russian (by Maxim Kernozhickii www.aeromultimedia.com)
 * Persian (by Ghaem Omidi www.forum.wp-parsi.com)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `advanced-access-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is "Initiate URL" button, under "Metaboxes & Widgets" Tab? =

Sometimes list of additional metaboxes is conditional on edit post page. Like e.g.
display custom metabox "Photos" only if Post Status is Published. Access Manager
initiates the list of metaboxes for each post in default status ("auto-draft").
That is why you have to manually initialize the URL to the edit post page where
the list of additional metaboxes can be picked by AAM.
