New user moderation, site lock-down or members area, users can chose their own password and must enter their name when registering.

== Description ==

IMPORTANT: v2.0+ does NOT have multisite support. The plugin will NOT protect any of your sites. I hope to include official multisite support in a future release.

After having a few odd registrations and comments on our family blog, my wife asked me to create a plugin that would give the blog security from strangers but still be easily accessible to family and friends. Absolute Privacy does just that! 

Absolute Privacy turns your WordPress blog into a fully private site where you control who has access. It's perfect for family blogs, private communities, and personal websites. You can lockdown the entire site or create a members only area, moderate new registrations, force users to enter first/last name and choose their password during sign up, and more!

Your site is now absolutely private!

== Installation ==

Simply upload to your wp-content/plugins folder and activate from the plugins menu. Nothing else to it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why can't users register?
Don't forget to enable user registration in the WordPress general options menu.

How do I use the shortcakes?
Simply enter the shortcode into the visual editor, brackets and all. Eg: [profilepage]

Where can I find more documentation?
Visit the plugins homepage
